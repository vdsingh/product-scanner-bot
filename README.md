# product-scanner-bot

product-scanner-bot is a discord bot that alerts users about the availability of high-demand products via discord message. It uses Selenium with Python (and is currently hosted on a Heroku web server) to detect changes in the HTML structure of a website and thus detect changes in the availability of a product.
